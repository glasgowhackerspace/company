\section*{Do we want multiple rooms or would we settle for a single room?}
\begin{itemize}

\item\textbf{For}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We may be unable to find a space of size at the start
    \item We may be able to find a space of size, albeit single open-plan room
    \item Multiple rooms may be expensive, and there may be noise requirements anyway which preclude a workshop area
  \end{enumerate}
\item\textbf{Preference}\\$\Box$ Must have multiple rooms $\Box$ Willing to settle for a single room
\end{itemize}
