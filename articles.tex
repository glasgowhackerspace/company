% Colourisation of certain clauses
%'
%' As regards to colour (like red text in the template we used),
%' use the \textcolor command directly on the block of text which is to
%' be coloured, not, e.g. wrapping a whole \itemize list or wrapping a
%' \subsection{} list.
%'
%' The reason for this is that the section numbering looks odd,
%' and for some reason it also introduces a spurrious new-line before the
%' list or section. It also seems to affect the indentation, even though
%' the only thing which changes is the colour.
\usepackage{xcolor}
% Links to article references
%'
%' We may want to have more informative links than "Article X.Y",
%' e.g. "Article 64.1 (Minutes)". Although there is a link in the PDF,
%' it makes it much more readable if we can have this.
%' This is something which only hyperref supports as far as I know.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Custom section numbering
%'
%' This bit was really annoying, basically we treat sections as top-level
%' titles like in the Book document class. We don't want to number them.
%' Just hiding the section numbering with titlesec means that there's an
%' extra padded section number in front of a given subsection.
%' There are other simpler tricks to do this but these then have the
%' problem of no continuation across sections, i.e. the subsections start
%' numbered from 1 again in each new section!

% Custom section formatting
%'
%' This compliments the section numbering above: note no argument
%' \thesection in \section's \titleformat incantation.
%'
%' The hang part in sub-/sub-sub-sections is pretty important.
%' The text otherwise appears at the very start of the next line!
%' I don't know why block doesn't work like this.
%' I just tried each titlesec shape option in the manual until I found
%' this one worked best.
%'
%' The desired behaviour of indentation of subsequent text is actually in
%' conflict with the expected behaviour. The expected behaviour is that
%' subsequent text should be aligned with the section body, which it is,
%' as our sub-/sub-sub-sections are not indented.
%'
%' Actually getting it to be aligned with the section body was fairly
%' difficult. One trick which works is to have the section body be a
%' text-box with a predictable indentation from the line, and also to
%' align the box to the left.
%'
%' I have defined a variable \clauseident which is inherited by the
%' sub/sub-sub-sections' as well as the \hangindent. I think it looks
%' good if those are roughly the same size.
%'
%' The neat suggestion to use a text box was adapted from the following TeX StackExchange answer: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/405372/align-section-with-text-body/405373#405373

% Environment to set indentation + hanging paragraph on lists
%' This is from the hang package, whereas the similarly-named hanging
%' package doesn't support itemised lists.
%'
% There are actually two types of indentation:
%' 1. A series of hanging paragraphs in a list (these are not labelled (a), (b) &c.)
%' 2. Indented lists, which aren't hanging (these are labelled (a), (b) &c.)
%'
%' The hang package actually supports both. I thought it was odd that it
%' didn't have labelled hanging lists, but I see in the template that they
%' don't hang labelled list items!
