% Colourisation of certain clauses
%'
%' As regards to colour (like red text in the template we used),
%' use the \textcolor command directly on the block of text which is to
%' be coloured, not, e.g. wrapping a whole \itemize list or wrapping a
%' \subsection{} list.
%'
%' The reason for this is that the section numbering looks odd,
%' and for some reason it also introduces a spurrious new-line before the
%' list or section. It also seems to affect the indentation, even though
%' the only thing which changes is the colour.

% Links to/labeling article references
%'
%' There was an error which we encountered when using hyperref, instead
%' of simple \label calls and \ref. Specifically, if we defined the
%' \label call *inside* the section title, e.g.,
%''     section{Artisan abacuses, slide rules\label{section:bestabacus}},
%' instead of outside of it, e.g.,
%''     section {Artisan abacuses, slide rules} \label{section:bestabacus}
%' there would occasionally be a warning (*not* an error) thrown that the
%' label was multiply-defined.
%'
%' Although this was obviously not true, it seemed fairly inoccuous,
%' and would work fine with regular \ref.
%' However, with hyperref, which we use below to get both the section
%' number and the shortened TOC section name (in brackets), there would
%' be bizarre failures. These included messages about TeX capacity,
%' which seemed to be related to crossreferencing and hyperref, e.g.
%' see the following:
%'' https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/655078/hyperref-why-am-i-getting-a-fatal-tex-capacity-exceeded-error
%'
%' However, this was very difficult to reproduce, and usually compiling the
%' document twice would get the label right. There were occasional issues
%' with the labels not coming up [the first time] or being linked to the
%' wrong section, but similarly, these were difficult to reproduce.
%' This seems to be partly related to the TeX design, in particular, as
%' far as I recall, it is fairly common to have to recompile LaTeX
%' documents in several passes, and there is some sort of caching going
%' on of build artefacts, or similar.
%'
%' The solution is as follows:
%'' 1. Define \label calls *following* the section declaration, i.e. as
%''    if they are text relating to the section!
%'' 2. Use latexmk(1) or rubber(1) to compile the document. Both of these
%''    seem to do the right number of passes, and after making sure that
%''    we follow (1) above, both 'settle' on a document after a number
%''    of passes, where they didn't before.
%'
%' A further point of interest (which made no difference) is that it
%' seems that certain packages must absolutely be loaded *after*
%' hyperref. This includes geometry, e.g. see the following:
%'' https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1863/which-packages-should-be-loaded-after-hyperref-instead-of-before

% These are fairly arbitrary.

% Custom section numbering
%'
%' This bit was really annoying, basically we treat sections as top-level
%' titles like in the Book document class. We don't want to number them.
%' Just hiding the section numbering with titlesec means that there's an
%' extra padded section number in front of a given subsection.
%' There are other simpler tricks to do this but these then have the
%' problem of no continuation across sections, i.e. the subsections start
%' numbered from 1 again in each new section!

% Custom section formatting
%'
%' This compliments the section numbering above: note no argument
%' \thesection in \section*'s \titleformat incantation.
%'
%' The hang part in sub-/sub-sub-sections is pretty important.
%' The text otherwise appears at the very start of the next line!
%' I don't know why block doesn't work like this.
%' I just tried each titlesec shape option in the manual until I found
%' this one worked best.
%'
%' The desired behaviour of indentation of subsequent text is actually in
%' conflict with the expected behaviour. The expected behaviour is that
%' subsequent text should be aligned with the section body, which it is,
%' as our sub-/sub-sub-sections are not indented.
%'
%' Actually getting it to be aligned with the section body was fairly
%' difficult. One trick which works is to have the section body be a
%' text-box with a predictable indentation from the line, and also to
%' align the box to the left.
%'
%' I have defined a variable \clauseident which is inherited by the
%' sub/sub-sub-sections' as well as the \hangindent. I think it looks
%' good if those are roughly the same size.
%'
%' The neat suggestion to use a text box was adapted from the following TeX StackExchange answer: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/405372/align-section-with-text-body/405373#405373

% Include unnumbered sections in the TOC
%'
%' This ensures that sub-sub-sections don't appear in the TOC, but
%' sections and sub-sections do.
%' Note, for including unnumbered sections (\section*{}), we have to
%' manually include them in the TOC, with a command similar to the
%' following:
%' \addcontents{toc}{section}{Slide Rules}
%'
\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}}

% Environment to set indentation + hanging paragraph on lists
%' This is from the hang package, whereas the similarly-named hanging
%' package doesn't support itemised lists.
%'
% There are actually two types of indentation:
%' 1. A series of hanging paragraphs in a list (these are not labelled (a), (b) &c.)
%' 2. Indented lists, which aren't hanging (these are labelled (a), (b) &c.)
%'
%' The hang package actually supports both. I thought it was odd that it
%' didn't have labelled hanging lists, but I see in the template that they
%' don't hang labelled list items!
